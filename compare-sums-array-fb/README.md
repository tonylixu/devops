### Problem definition
Given an array, find if the sum of sub-array1 is equal to the sum of the sub-array2. Assume the array length is even, and it can be divided into two arrays. The length of array is equal to the length of sub-array1 plus sub-array2. 

For example:
```bash
nums = [1, 1, 2, 4]
Your program should print [1, 2, 3] and [4] 
```

Notes: Assume there are at least two elements in the array
