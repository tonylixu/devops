## Storage Basics
* Concurrency: Do you understand threads, deadlock and starvation? What happens when multiple processes/threads are trying to modify the same data? A basic understanding of read and write locks.
* Newworking: Do you roughly understand basic networking protocls like TCP and UDP?
* File systems: You should understand the systems you are building upon. Do you know roughly how an OS, file system, and database work? Do you know about the various levels of caching in a modern OS?

## Basic terminologies
* Replication: Replication refers to frequently copying the data across multiple machines. Post replication, multiple copies of data exists across machines.
