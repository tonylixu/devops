### Introduction
When you turn on a server, the processor attempts to begin the process of processing data. But, since the system memory is empty, the processor doesn't really have anything to execute, or even begin to know where to look for it. To ensure the server always boot regardless of the BIOS code, both chip and BIOS manufacturers developed their code so that the processor, once turned on, always starts executing at the same place, `FFFF0h`.

Similarly, every hard disk must have a consistent "starting point" where key information is stored about the disk, such as the number of partitions and what type they are. There also must be someplace where the BIOS can load the initial boot program that starts the process of loading the operating system.
