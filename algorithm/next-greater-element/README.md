### Problem definition
You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2.

The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.

### Examples
Example 1
```python
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
    For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
```

Example 2
```python
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4].
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
```

Notes:
* All elements in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
* The length of both nums1 and nums2 would not exceed 1000.

### Solution analysis
We can traverse nums1 array, for each element, we find its position in nums2. If it is the last element, we return `-1`, otherwise we compare it with the rest of right element in nums2.

In Python, you can use the list index() function to find the elements index.

### Pesudo code
```python
# Traverse through the first array
for i in nums1:
    index = nums2.index(i)
    # Place holder if we find the numer
    find_it = 0
    # If it is the last element
    if index == len(nums2) - 1:
        re.append(-1)
    else:
        # Traverse the rest of right array
        for j in range(index+1, len(nums2)):
            if i < nums2[j]:
                re.append(nums2[j])
                find_it = 1
                # Until we find one
                break
        # If no find in the rest of right array
        if find_it == 0:
            re.append(-1)
    return re
```

### Complexity analysis
* Time complexity O(n^2)
* Space complexity O(n)
