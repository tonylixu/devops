## Problem Definition
Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

```bash
Example:
Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
```
Note: In the string, each word is separated by single space and there will not be any extra space in the string.

### Complexity Analysis
* Time Complexity: O(n), n is the number of element in the string
* Space Complexity: O(n), n is the number of element in the string
