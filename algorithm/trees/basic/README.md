## Trees

### How to choose datastructure
* What needs to be stored?
* Cost of operations?
* Memory usage?
* Ease of implementation

### Tree
Tree is normally been used to represent hierarchy data. For example, employee in the organization. Tree can also be called a recursive data structure.

In a tree with N nodes, there will be exactly (N-1) edges (All nodes except the root has one incoming link/edge).

Tree datastructure can be defined as a collection of entities called nodes linked together to simulate hierrachy. Tree is non-linear.

### Terms
* root
* children
* parent
* sibling: have same parent
* leaf: has no child
* ancestor
* descendent
* depth of x: length of path from root to x
* height of x: Number of edges in the longest path from x to a leaf. Hight of a tree is the height of the root node.

### Tree Applications
* Stroing naturally
  * hierarchical data: file system
* Organize data
  * For quick search, insertion, deletion
* Trie
  * dictionary
* Network and routing
