### Problem Definition
A level-order traversal, also known as a breadth-first search, visits each level of a tree's nodes from left to right, top to bottom. You are given a pointer, `root`, pointing to the root of a binary search tree. Complete the levelOrder function provided in your editor so that it prints the level-order traversal of the binary search tree.

Hint: You'll find a queue helpful in completing this challenge.

### Input Format
The locked stub code in your editor reads the following inputs and assembles them into a BST: 
The first line contains an integer,  `T`(the number of test cases). 
The `T` subsequent lines each contain an integer, data, denoting the value of an element that must be added to the BST.
