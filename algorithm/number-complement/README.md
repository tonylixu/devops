## Problem Definition
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Notes:
* The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
* You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

### Example:
```bash
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
```

### Complexity analysis
* Time complexity: O(n), n is the length of number digits
* Space complexity: O(n)
