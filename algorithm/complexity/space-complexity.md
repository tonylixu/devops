## How to Analyze Space Complexity
Space complexity is a measure of how efficient your code is in terms of memory used. Space complexity analysis happends almost in the same way time complexity analysis happens.

For example:
```bash
array = []
for i in range(n):
    array[i] = i+1
```
The above code ends up creating an array of size N. So the space complexity of the code is O(N).
