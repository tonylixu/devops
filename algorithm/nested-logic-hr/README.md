### Problem Definition
Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:
* If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (fine = 0)
* If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date, fine = 15 Hackos x (the number of days late)
* If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the fine = 500 Hackos x (the number of months late)
* If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of 10000 Hackos.
