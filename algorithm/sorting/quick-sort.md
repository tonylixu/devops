## Quick Sort
Quick sort is a in-place sorting algorithm, which means it takes constant of memory. The average time complexity of quick sort is O(nlogn), but the worst case time complexity is O(n^2). Quick sort is also a recursive sorting algorithm.

Quick sort is pretty fast in practical scenarios.
